# Mirabai Cuenca Ardura
I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Regulatory Genomics and Diabetes group]https://www.crg.eu/en/programmes-groups/ferrer-lab at the [Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG)]https://www.crg.eu/en, as part of the Computational Biology and Health Genomics Department. 

During my PhD in the laboratory of Prof. Jorge Ferrer, I designed, executed and analyzed a CRISPR KO and a CRISPRa screen to uncover regulators of a key transcription factor that harbours genetic variants that contribute to human diabetes mellitus  at the CRG. I integrated the data from the genetic screens with a high-throughput chemical screen to discover genes and pathways that could be targeted by drugs to increase the levels of this transcription factor in diabetic patients. I also used gene co-expression analysis from single-cell data in primary human pancreatic islets to validate these findings in an independent model. Finally, I used a list of genes contributing to the risk of diabetes to prioritise drug targets with more potential to suceed in drug-discovery pipelines. Once published, this work will constitute a resource that can be generalized to other disease contexts for identifying new therapeutic targets. 

In addition, I generated a stem-cell-derived model of human monogenic diabetes and I characterised it using single-cell profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility, and transcription factor binding studies (CUT&Tag).

Finally, I have a passion for science communication, either to field experts or to broader audiences.

Here some tools / languages I use:
